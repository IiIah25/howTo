   <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>1½ cups warm water</li>
    <li>10 g (2tsp) instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>3-4 cups flour (any white flour can be used: Cake, all purpose or bread)</li>
    <li>1 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/3 cup butter / oil (room temperature butter)</li>
   </ul>
   <h3 class ="steps">Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>1. Whisk water, sugar and yeast together. Allow to stand for 10 minutes until foamy.</li>
    <li>2. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine the flour and salt.</li>
    <li>3. With the mixer running, add the water and allow to knead in.</li>
    <li>4. Add the butter or oil, allow to knead in then add more flour, one third cup at a time until the dough is smooth.</li>
    <li>5. Knead for another minuted until the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
    <li>6. If the dough is still very sticky, add more flour and knead in. </li>
    <li>7. The dough should be smooth and soft and only a slight bit sticky.</li>
    <li>8. Cover with plastic or a damp tea towel and allow to rise for 1 hour.</li>
    <li>9. Once the dough has proofed, press it into rectangle on a lightly floured surface. Roll onto its self into a log, pinch the seam then transfer to a loaf pan that has been lightly greased.</li>
    <li>10. Covere again and allow to rise for 30 minutes while you preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F.</li>
    <li>11. Place in the oven and allow to bake for 30-45 minutes until golden brown and risen. Once baked the bread will sound hollow when tapped on the bottom.</li>
    <li>12. Remove, brush with a little butter and allow to cool before slicing.</li>

    <h3 id="soup">Lentil Soup</h3>
    <img src="./resources/images/lentilSoup.jpg.jpg"/>
    <h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil (I used Early Harvest)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tsp dry oregano</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp cumin</li>
            <li>1 tsp rosemary</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>2 dry bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes (from a can)</li>
            <li>7 cups low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>2 cups red lentils, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Zest of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>Juice of 2 lemons</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley for garnish</li>
            <li>Crumbled feta cheese to serve, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>1. Heat 3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add onions, carrots and garlic. Cook 3  to 4 minutes, stirring regularly. Add spices and bay leaves. Cook for a few seconds till fragrant, keep stirring so spices don’t burn.</li>
        <li>2. Add crushed tomatoes, broth, lentils. Season with kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then lower heat to simmer for 15 to 20 minutes, until lentils are fully cooked.
        </li>
        <li>3. Remove from heat. If you have the time, let soup cool a bit before using an immersion blender to puree. Pulse a few times till you reach the creamy consitency you are looking for.</li>
        <li>4. Return soup to heat, and stir to warm through. Add lemon zest, lemon juice, and fresh parsley.</li>
        <li>5. Transfer soup to serving bowls and top with extra virgin olive oil. If you like, top each bowl with a generous sprinkle of feta cheese. Serve with your favorite crusty bread!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Cook’s Tips: Be sure the lentils are fully cooked before blending. To achieve creamy consistency, don’t skip blending the soup. I find using an immersion blender on low speed (and while heat is off) is an easier and less messy way to blend the soup. But if you need to, you can use a food processor or a stand-up blender. If you do so, blend the soup in batches to avoid it overflowing.</p>
